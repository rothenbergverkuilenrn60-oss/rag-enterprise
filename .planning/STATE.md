## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Logged (v1.1)

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| PP-StructureV3 over raw PP-OCRv5 | Layout + table + reading-order recovery in one pipeline; right granularity for GB national-standard PDFs |
| Bake OCR models into Docker image | Cold-start download is 10–60s and flaky behind enterprise proxies; image size delta (~600MB–1.2GB) is acceptable |
| Singleton + asyncio.to_thread + bounded semaphore | PP-StructureV3 has no documented thread safety; this is the safe contract under FastAPI/ARQ |
| Section heading text in embedded content; numeric IDs in metadata only | High-cardinality numerics (page_number) dilute embeddings; heading words help recall (verified anti-pattern via LlamaIndex guidance) |
| pgvector `hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order` + raised `ef_search` when filter active | Default post-filter recall collapses on selective filters; iterative scan keeps walking the HNSW graph until k matches found |
| Regex-first query filter extractor (no LLM in v1.1) | 100% deterministic, zero per-query cost; LLM fallback deferred to v1.2 |
| Static HTML via FastAPI StaticFiles (no bundler) | v1.1 ceiling is "edit like a normal frontend file" — no React/Vue/build step |
| Diff-cover gate on touched files only | Legacy 46% floor stays as informational; v1.1 does not block on legacy code |

### Pitfalls to Avoid (v1.1)

- PaddleOCR is **not thread-safe** — never call `predict()` from multiple threads on the same instance
- Forgetting `hnsw.iterative_scan` is the silent killer — `page_number=63` filter on default `ef_search=40` returns near-zero results
- Do not prepend "Page 63 — section 3.10:" into embedded text — verified to dilute recall
- CMYK is an *image-extraction* problem, not an OCR problem — full-page rasterization in PP-StructureV3 renders to RGB regardless of source colorspace
- Model warmup latency 10–60s on cold start — pre-warm in ARQ worker `on_startup`
- Section IDs in GB docs use multiple formats (`3.10`, `附录A.1`, `表5`) — start with `\d+\.\d+`, extend from real query logs; do not over-engineer upfront
- `ef_search=200` raises latency 3–5x — acceptable for v1.1 single-tenant low-QPS, revisit when scaling

### Open Questions (v1.1)

1. OCR worker placement — same ARQ pool with separate `ocr_queue` vs separate container? (research leans separate container)
2. PP-StructureV3 vs MinerU/Marker/Surya — flag for follow-up if PaddleOCR latency proves unacceptable on real GB PDFs
3. Section ID extraction — trust PP-StructureV3 `block_order` heading detection or run regex `^第?\d+(\.\d+)*\s+...` over markdown output? (recommend regex over markdown, fall back to V3 blocks)
4. paddlepaddle exact patch pin (3.0.0 vs 3.0.1) — needs `pip install --dry-run` on actual build host before locking Dockerfile
5. `hnsw.ef_search=200` is a guess — needs eval set with known page/section ground truth

### Blockers

None.

### Todos

- User: `docker compose build rag-api` then `bash scripts/verify_ocr_bake.sh` then `pytest tests/integration/test_ocr_e2e.py -m integration -x -s` inside container — closes Phase 7 SC #1 and SC #3 live verification.
- Plan Phase 8: `/gsd-plan-phase 8` (Multimodal Metadata + Query Filter — META-01, META-02, QUERY-01)

## Session Continuity

**Last updated:** 2026-04-27 22:00 — Phase 7 executed (2 plans, 9 commits) and verified (15/15 criteria PASS in code)
**Stopped at:** Phase 10 context gathered
**Next action:** User runs docker rebuild + e2e; in parallel, can run `/gsd-plan-phase 8` to plan Multimodal Metadata + Query Filter

**Phase 7 artifacts:** 07-01-SUMMARY.md, 07-02-SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md

**Planned Phase:** 8 (Multimodal Metadata + Query Filter) — 5 plans — 2026-05-08T02:55:02.368Z
